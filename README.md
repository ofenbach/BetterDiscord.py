# BetterDiscord.py
Beautiful 100% Python made Voice Chat with less delay than discord!

# idea
Discord has quite a delay which is especially annoying e.g. for musicians who want to play together.  
It also doesn't have a good audio quality (expect for buying boosts ...).  
The goal of this project is to create an 100% python based voice chat system with studio audio quality and (almost) no delay.  

# screenshots  

# technology
This chat uses the most precise audio quality possible with the lowest delay.  
It also got features like noise supression or echo cancellation built into it.
